# Web-3D-Website

Created a responsive and mobile first Product Site centred around X3D, while conforming to an MVC design pattern. The front end was developed using HTML5, CSS3, Boostrap4, JavaScipt, jQuery, X3DOM, Ajax to update and change webpages asynshconrously and JSON for the retrieval of data from the backend to the frontend. PHP was used for all scripting and accessing and modifying the data in an sqlite database.
All 3D models were created and animated by myself using Cinema4D and 3ds Max.

To run this website I recommend hosting a local server with the 3DAppWebsite as the root.
